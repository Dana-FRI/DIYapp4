Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to help a patient or user distinguish between allergies and the common cold. The code is supposed to ask a series of questions to diagnose one or the other.
 
Known Issues:
This app is extremely basic and doesn't include a comprehensive amount of questions to distinguish between cold and allergies.

<script>
// dana - i'm thinking that it will be var covidyes_count, and var covidno_count and define the functions that way OR it will be the FLU versus CORONA, I will have to find symtpoms that are not so close to each other in order to make that distinction 

	var covid_count = 0; // creates a variable known as allergy_count and stores the initial value as zero (tally of symptoms leaning towards allergy diagnosis)
        var flu_count = 0; // creates a variable known as cold_count and stores the initial value as zero. (tally of symptoms leaning towards cold diagnosis)
	

	// dana -changing the order of this (putting it further down) var resultText = document.getElementById("results"); // creates variable for our actual final result

        function covidAdd(){
		covid_count = covid_count + 1; // this function will help us add one each time a symptom is linked to allergies.
		alert(covid_count); // added this alert as well just in case
		
        }; // dana - I added the semi-colon just for structure, it helped with my last app 3 so i'm using it again
	   // dana - i'm trying to come up with questions for my code - i'm thinking of doing the COVID-19 pandemic, answering 4 different types of questions - have to be able to distinguish between the flu and corona - which is hard because they are similar 
        
	function fluAdd(){
		flu_count = flu_count + 1; // this function will help us add one each time a symptom is linked to cold.
		alert(flu_count); // dana - once again added this alert to fimiliarize the code to pop-out what I need it to
		
        };
	
	function ResultPercentage(){ // dana - make sure consistent with code at the bottom 	
	var covidPercent = (cold_count/4) * 100; 
	var fluPercent = (allergy_count/4) * 100;
	var resultText = document.getElementById("results")
	resultText.innerHTML = "Probability it is Covid-19 =" + covidPercent + "%<br> Probability it is a flu =" + fluPercent + "%"; 

	// dana - var allergyPercent=0; // initial value for variable of allergy in  percentage form
	// dana - var coldPercent=0; // initial value for variable of cold in  percentage form
	// dana - I just took this out and decided to make it more personliazed by changing the name, function results(){ // function that allows us to get our final result
		// dana - var allergyPercent= allergy_count/ (allergy_count + cold_count) * 100; // a variable to create percent likelihood of allergies
		// dana - var coldPercent= cold_count/ (allergy_count+ cold_count)* 100; // a variable to create percent likelihood of cold
		// dana - var resultText = document.getElementById("results"); //
